# ZL-project

ZL-project is an open-source project to make a game that works with
[Solarus](https://github.com/solarus-games/solarus),
an open-source adventure 2D game engine.
(See below for further information). 

- ZL means "Zelda-like", so this is not in Zelda's world, but it looks like it.
- However, they are tiles and sprites, in some images, from official games that belong to Nintendo.
This content is provides under fair use.
